## 1. Instructions for Java Native Interface

> This section is only for **00-03** titled experiments (<span style="background-color: #FFff21">JNI related</span>
) in this repository.

### 1.1 Requirements

1. A Java Compiler “javac” which ships with the SDK
2. A Java Virtual Machine “java” which ships with the SDK
3. A native method c header file generator “javah” which ships with the SDK.
4. A C/C++ compiler “cc” that can create shared library

### 1.2 Steps for output

**To run the program related java native interface follow the following commands for linux on terminal :**

- Compile the java code.

```bash
 javac <filename>.java
```

- Create C/C++ header file.

```bash
javah <Use the Java class file name without the “.class” extention>
```

- Create a shared library file using the C/C++ file created using terminal.

```bash
gcc -fPIC -I"/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_181/include" -I"/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_181/include/linux" --shared -o <the shared library file name you need/want to create>.so <C file name>.c
```

- Run the java program.

```bash
java -Djava.library.path=. <name of java class file>
```
